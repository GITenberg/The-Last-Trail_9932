description: Known by the Indians as le vent de la mort (the wind of death), Wetzel
  and his partner Jonathan Zane are hard on the trail of white rustlers led by Simon
  Girty and Bing Leggitt. One night at their campfire Helen Sheppard and her father,
  who have become lost in the forest on their way to Fort Henry, are approached by
  Wetzel and Zane. For Jonathan Zane and Helen Sheppard this accidental encounter
  is the beginning of a romance that will be fraught with many dangers. Betty Zane,
  whose dash for gunpowder in the defense of Fort Henry during the Revolutionary War
  is now legendary, and her brother, Colonel Ebenezer Zane, are also among the characters
  in this novel, older now, sharing their wisdom and experiences with a younger generation.
